## Purpose ##

---

**The goal** of this project is to provide software that allows the users to **Download a whole branch of files and folders from their Highlearn account in an organized manner**


## Background ##

---

Many academic institutes in Israel use the "Highlearn" system as their content management system, and it has lots of downsides.

## Why Open-Source ? ##

---

This project began as a private one, and gained lots of interest from many students across Israel from different universities. Over the years it became impossible to continue and develop this software by only one person.

The source code has been released as an Open-Source, and hopefully this will allow the project to grow and answer more issues than before.
